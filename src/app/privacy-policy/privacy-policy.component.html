Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not fully secure, and although&nbsp;Mexican Kitchen endeavors to protect personal information against unauthorized access or distribution, we cannot guarantee the security of personal information transmitted to Mexican Kitchen's website or social media pages, and such transmission of personal information is at the individual&rsquo;s own risk.
